# Dataset Information

The objective of this task is to detect negative speech in tweets. We say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a hate sentiment associated with it. So,the task is to classify negative tweets from other tweets.

Formally,given a training sample of tweets and labels,where label'1'denotes the tweet is negative and label'0' denotes the positive tweet, your objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.

For training the model,we provide a labelled dataset of 31,962 tweets. The dataset is provided in the form of a csv file with each line storing a tweet id,its label and the tweet.
